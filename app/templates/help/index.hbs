		<h3>How do I create another radio?</h3>
		<p>You have one single radio to present your taste in music. Put it on shuffle and enjoy your music — don't worry about genres… and playlists.</p>

		<h3>How do I change the URL of my radio?</h3>
		<p>Go to your radio, tap <em>'Edit'</em> and look for <em>'URL'</em>. We suggest you use the same URL as your title.</p>

		<h3>How do I add tracks from Bandcamp, Soundcloud etc.?</h3>
		<p>For now, we want to focus on creating the best possible experience on top of YouTube. We're considering more sources.</p>

		<h3>Why doesn't it play on my iPhone and iPad?</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately Apple decided to disallow autoplaying of videos on iOS. While we work around it, we suggest you buy an Android device. Sorry.</p>
